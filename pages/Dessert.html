        These cookies are perfect. I didn’t have any cardamom so I did half a teaspoon of salt in with half a cup of sugar to roll the dough – incredible. These are DEFINITELY a recipe to save and make over and over and over

        Let no holiday pass without cookies! Really, let nothing pass without cookies. Especially thick, soft-centered, crispy-edged, dark, rich, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate cookies. Laced with espresso powder and with a snowy sprinkle of cardamom sugar on top (optional, but such a wintery treat). They’re beautiful, festive, deeply delicious, and you’re going to be lucky if they last a day in your house. Be prepared when you set them out. People will come in droves…family, friends, neighbors, the Amazon delivery person may wander in and grab one for the road.

        They are truly remarkable. So put some in your pockets before they’re gone.

        <h3>Ingredians</h3>
        <p>Cardamom is interesting because you can’t exactly place it, but you can tell when it’s not there. It’s just slightly warmer, a tinge of something special, a little Christmasy speckle on your palate. It is certainly not required to make these cookies delicious, they are unbelievable with or without, but it really is worth a try. And let’s be serious here, you’re going to wind up making batch after batch of these on repeat, so why not dust one batch with this wintery spice?
<br>
            To make the rest of the magic happen, you’ll want to gather up:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>your cookie basics: butter, brown sugar, eggs, flour, baking soda, salt</li>
            <li>vanilla</li>
            <li>cocoa powder</li>
            <li>extra sugar for rolling</li>
            <li>cardamom (optional)</li>
            <li>espresso powder (also optional, but let’s be fun)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A warm heart? A festive spirit? A readiness to chomp chocolate cookies for the rest of your holiday days? Also on the list.</p>

            How To Make Chocolate Cookies
        </h3>
        <p>It’s hard to choose what to love most about these cookies, but the fact that they’re a real mix & bake, no-fuss kinda situation certainly makes the list!
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the dough.</b> Cream butter and sugar and then add the eggs and vanilla until just combined. Then, in goes the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder (if using, but remember, let’s be fun), baking soda, and salt. Stir and mix it all together.</li>
            <li><b>Form into balls.</b> About 1/4 cup per ball because you mean it. Roll each in the extra sugar (or cardamom sugar if you’re feeling festive!).</li>
            <li><b>Bake in batches.</b> We recommend 6-8 at a time. Remove from oven and LET. THEM. REST. so you get the crispy edges and soft craggy middles. Transfer to a wire cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>

We’re feeling all the feelings these days. Admittedly, the Christmas music 
is already playing and we’re so ready for things to be glowy and merry and bright. We’re so ready to keep 
our stand mixers busy and our rolling pins dusted because there’s nothing quite like deep chocolatey cookie smells swirling through the air and your home being filled with the extra warmth from the oven. Merry, merry indeed. Happy cookie-making!
