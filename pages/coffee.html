        The creamiest morning coffee you’ve ever had! Made with just coffee,
        cashews, honey, and sea salt.
      </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 serving of strongly brewed coffee (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cashews (roasted and unsalted is my favorite)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey (more or less to taste)</li>
        <li>a small pinch of coarse sea salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Blend all ingredients for about 45 seconds in a high-powered blender.
          Start on a lower speed and gradually work your way up, ending with
          about 15 seconds on a very high speed to ensure smooth and creamy
          texture.
        </li>
        <li>Pour into a mug and enjoy, or chill for later (see notes)!</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>NOTES</h3>
      <p>
        Notes about cold vs. hot cashew coffee: Cashews straight out the package
        should blend just fine with hot coffee (although if you’re particular,
        just give them an overnight soak). If you want to a COLD cashew coffee,
        you have two options.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Option 1- Blend everything while the coffee is hot and then chill it
          overnight in a jar with a lid. It will separate, so just give it a
          good shake in the morning and pour over ice and you’ll be good to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Option 2- Soak your cashews in water for a few hours and give them a
          good rinse. Now they should blend up nicely with cold coffee – either
          cold press or just chilled brewed coffee.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I used very coarse flaked sea salt in this coffee, so just a word to the
        wise that it might not be best to put 1/2 teaspoon of regular table salt
        in the coffee! That will be way too salty. If using table salt, just
        start with a tiny pinch and taste and adjust from there.
